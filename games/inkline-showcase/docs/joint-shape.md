# Joint shape — 1.4.5

Final model and joint checks pass for all 12 bodies. The independent review covers saved standard-body black and thin pale poses, including a 390 px phone image. Final archive and local delivery checks have separate receipts.

The earlier elbow and knee rings use equal weights from the two adjacent bones. That blend compresses the tube during a bend. The new construction uses rigid upper and lower tube sections. Each section has a round end at the joint. Both sections use the same radius. The target is a uniform drawn line through the bend, without a narrow joint or a wider joint dot.

Each exported figure keeps 18 bones and 85 clips. Each has one skinned mesh, one material, ten connected surface parts, and 2,416 triangles. This adds 704 triangles per figure, or 41.1%, compared with the prior 1,712-triangle mesh. Mesh and bone counts do not add draw calls. Pale outlines still require their existing extra pass. No mobile frame-rate improvement is claimed.

Evidence is in `docs/verification/joints`. The main check (regenerable with `scripts/verify-joint-shape.ts`; raw trace not committed) passes 14,520 checks. It measures all 85 clips, four joints, and thickness values 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3. Joint surface radius stays between 0.99996983 and 1.00002707 of its rest value. Local edge lengths stay between 0.99996876 and 1.00002759. Before/after images are published as `public/review/joint-before.png` and `public/review/joint-after.png`. The saved views show continuous pale contours without a visible narrow joint or wider dot.

The animation authoring and bake source remain unchanged. Bone layout, clip IDs, track layout, and timing also remain unchanged. The larger joint surface changes some floor-contact results. The largest local leg rotation change is 1.878 degrees. Most clips retain a 20 mm world-position limit and a 2 degree rotation limit. Other track values retain a 0.00001 tolerance.

Forward recovery has two exceptional samples at 0.300 seconds. The heavy body rises 23.609 mm. The sentinel rises 20.949 mm. Both changes are vertical. The new knee caps would enter the floor without these changes. Forward recovery is not a grounded clip. Its separate clearance check limits the correction to the measured knee radius and requires the surface to stay from -1 to 20 mm above the floor at these samples. Measured heights are 14.992 mm and 15.396 mm. Read `ground-rebake.json` for the source classification and exact samples. Exported pose values are not all identical.

Prior motion, foot contact, stance, firearm, reload, grip, avatar, spine, style, and timing checks pass. New recordings cover all 85 clips and identify the final source and model hashes. The independent visual review used saved stills; it does not claim continuous review of these films. The 1.4.4 receipt is retained as `docs/verification/correction/final-review-1.4.4.json`. The external delivery receipt is `docs/verification/joints/joint-delivery.json`. Both archives exclude that receipt.

Prior runtime limits remain. Run-to-idle blends can move support feet. Ramp movement has no separate terrain target for each foot. No new performance result is claimed. Earlier measurements are historical. Physical Android performance remains unverified.
